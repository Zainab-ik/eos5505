    "Title": "Rat liver microsomal stability",
    "Description": "Hepatic metabolic stability is key to ensure the drug attains the desired concentration in the body. The Rat Liver Microsomal (RLM) stability is a good approximation of a compoundâ€™s stability in the human body, and NCATS has collected a proprietary dataset of 20216 compounds with its associated RLM (in vitro half-life; unstable < 30 min, stable >30 min) and used it to train a classifier based on an ensemble of several ML approaches (random forest, deep neural networks, graph convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks)",
    "Mode": "Pretrained",
    "Input": ["Compound"],
    "Input Shape": "Single",
    "Task": ["Classification"],
    "Output": ["Probability"],
    "Interpretation": "Probability of a compound being stable in RLM (half-life >30min)",
